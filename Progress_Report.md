#Progress report on the Information Visualization Project

Week 1:

Week 2: 

Week 3:

Discussed the on how the visualization would roughly look like and how the flow of user interactions will be.
~fill with discussion results~

Split work into 3 different parts.

⋅⋅* Model for learning user preference (Alice)

⋅⋅* Finding new datasets to link and analyzing/preprocessing data (Gamma & Tavneet)
  
⋅⋅⋅Found 2 datasets that we can potentially use for this project. One has the living expenses for cities acrros the world and another has 
⋅⋅⋅data on what we can possibly use to calculate crime index/safety level. The datasets are pretty much straightforward and do not need any analysis.
  
⋅⋅⋅For the flickr dataset itself we parsed the xml file and extracted the metadata that would be relevant to our project. First we take only
⋅⋅⋅images that has a location tag on the photos, then we check each url if the link is dead or not. Following that, we also filtered out
⋅⋅⋅some photos that might not be relevant to our case by using the tag (possibly labels in the future), though we are not yet sure if this
⋅⋅⋅is the best approach yet to retrieve images relevant to us.


⋅⋅* Design and Visualiztion (Jiachen & Chenghan)
